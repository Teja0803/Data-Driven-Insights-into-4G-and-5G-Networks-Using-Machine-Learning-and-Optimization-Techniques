# Data-Driven-Insights-into-4G-and-5G-Networks-Using-Machine-Learning-and-Optimization-Techniques
This project explores 4G and 5G network datasets through advanced machine learning techniques. The 4G dataset was used for unsupervised learning, where multiple clustering algorithms—including KMeans, Gaussian Mixture Models, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering—were applied. Clustering performance was evaluated using Silhouette Scores, Calinski-Harabasz Index, and Davies-Bouldin Index. The 5G dataset was utilized for both binary and multi-class classification tasks using Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Gradient Boosting classifiers. Models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Feature importance and SHAP values were analyzed to interpret model decisions. Additionally, Genetic Algorithms were implemented to optimize hyperparameters for both clustering and classification models, demonstrating measurable performance improvements over baseline models. The project includes detailed preprocessing steps like missing value handling, outlier removal, skewness correction, and feature scaling. Visualizations and reports are included to aid interpretability and present actionable insights for telecom data analysis.

### Dataset Description:
The 4G dataset contains extensive drive-test measurements collected during mobile network performance assessments. It includes over 500,000 rows of observations with features related to signal strength, quality metrics (e.g., SINR, RSRP, RSRQ), GPS coordinates, mobility information (speed, distance), and cell configuration details. Due to its raw nature, it contains missing values and variability, making it well-suited for preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, clustering, and unsupervised learning tasks. The dataset is ideal for identifying patterns in signal behavior and network coverage zones.

The 5G dataset is a structured and cleaner collection of radio signal measurements focused on 5G New Radio (NR) performance. It includes features related to signal strength and quality (e.g., SSS-SINR, PBCH-RSRQ), transmission parameters, and estimated distances from the base station. The dataset is large-scale and well-distributed across different signal conditions, which supports both binary and multi-class classification tasks. It is ideal for evaluating signal quality and predicting network performance using supervised learning algorithms.
